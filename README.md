# dotfiles

These are my (and not so much my) dotfiles.
Here are the dotfiles for:
* [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
* [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org) 
* [Yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi)
* [NeoVim](https://neovim.io)

For programs I have used before ü´°
* [LF](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf)

All configs was written for KDE system usage.

## Usage ##

Just organize the files into folders, or use scripts:

```
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```
Follow the instructions. Your existing files will be overwritten. But don't worry, the script will ask you what to overwrite and what not.

To import updated configs:
```
chmod +x ./import.sh
./import.sh
```
This will overwrite all files in `config` directory.

All scripts are simply to edit. Use them ü§ç
